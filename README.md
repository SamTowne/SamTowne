- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SamTowne
- I use this account to learn tech and try new things.
- I require black coffee.
- I enjoy building self-contained serverless apps.
- There is much to be gained (cost-savings, efficiency, ease of management) by replacing long-standing application infrastructure with serverless tech.
